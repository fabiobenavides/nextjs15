If you have code that must never end up on the client-side (no matter if it's a server action or not), you should instead use the server-only package as described here.

Running Prod mode:
npm run build
npm start

Prod code: ./next folder


4 types of cache: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching

Next 15+ cache is less agressive

Way to control the cache:

1- In the specific fetch
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/messages', {
    //cache: 'no-store', //next 14 default 'force-cache' -- next 15 default 'no-store' less agressive
    next: {
      revalidate: 5 //seconds for next revalidate cache
    }
  });
